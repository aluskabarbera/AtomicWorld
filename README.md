# AtomicWorld
With this application you can calculate the atoms of each element in a molecule. And on the other hand you can 'simulate' a Big Bang.

Requirements:
Have the latest version of Python.
Install or have the pip package manager installed. (It's very simple, there are many tutorials where they explain it.)
And finally run the command pip3 install colorama in the terminal.
  
How born this code:
Some time ago I saw that I could program the operations we do to calculate the atoms in a molecule.
So I decided to automate this task.
Then, within the "Periodic table" option, you can calculate the atomic weight, moles, molecules, atoms, protons and neutrons, quarks and their mass.

And in the "Standard model" part I had the idea of associating each subelement to a binary number.
So, I decided that within a string of random zeros and ones, find if any byte had matched, if so, I would color it by the family it belongs to and finally translate the byte to its corresponding name.

Functioning:
It's very simple, you just have to read and follow the steps.
You must write down the results because they are not stored anywhere.
Hope you enjoy the app. Ah, remember with great power comes great responsibility. 

Acknowledgment:
I thank all the programmers who have helped me, and myself.

Maintenance:
This code is under a license (although I think I have the wrong license, because I have no idea of licenses.) But in it you are free to run it wherever and whenever you want, to be able to modify it and distribute it freely.

Post data: If you modified something, and it was for the better, could I know?
