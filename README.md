# AtomicWorld
With this application you can calculate the atoms of each element in a molecule. And on the other hand you can 'simulate' a Big Bang.

# Description:
The Molecule Calculator program is a tool that allows you to calculate various properties of a molecule composed of up to four chemical elements. The user can enter the names and subscripts of the elements that make up the molecule, as well as their physical weight in grams, and the program will calculate and display detailed information about the composition of the molecule, including the number of moles, the number of molecules, the number of atoms, the number of protons and neutrons, as well as the mass in MeV/c^2 of the Up and Down quarks present in the protons and neutrons of each element.

# Main Features:

   __·__ Calculation of the number of moles in the molecule.

   __·__ Calculation of the number of molecules in the molecule.

   __·__ Calculation of the number of atoms of each element in the molecule.

   __·__ Calculation of the number of protons and neutrons of each element in the molecule.

   __·__ Calculation of the mass in MeV/c^2 of the Up and Down quarks present in the protons and neutrons of each element.

# Logic Used:
The program uses a series of formulas and calculations based on the information provided about the chemical elements, including their atomic mass, number of protons and neutrons, as well as the mass in MeV/c^2 of the Up and Down quarks.

# Development of the program:
The program has been developed using the Python programming language. The following libraries have been used:

**'random'**: Used to generate random numbers in the program.

**'colorama'**: Used for the color format in the program output.

**'time'**: Used to calculate the execution of the program at certain points for a better user experience.
